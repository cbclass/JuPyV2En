I.e. the second `input()` is executed after the loop, therefore `name` is not modified and remains different from Peter, if a different name was entered first. The loop will thus go on printing \"Access is only allowed for Peter.\". This can only be stopped by **interrupting the kernel**. Please click on the square in the toolbar to do so. \n",
